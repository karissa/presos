Unfortunate side-effect of open data: silos, difficult to access. open doesn't mean easy

look at sue.

sue is a data analyst. she finds data from the internet and makes sense out of it.

ok, sue wants to do a study on water quality around the world.

first, she needs to get data about the quality of water. catalogue it. and analyze it.

does searches.
ckan portals -> “water quality” -> copy link -> download
socrata portals -> craft SODA query -> wait -> download
custom portals -> “click click click” -> copy link -> download

etc..

once the data is all downloaded, we can make awesome charts, graphs, analysis, policy papers, news articles, everything!

… but what happens if the data changes? sue will have to repeat the process in order to find out..if she doesn't, bad things could happen (science, journalism)
…. what if the data becomes unavailable? no one else can replicate it. (internet archive)
…. how about if the data is really large? it might take forever to download if the server is slow (wikipedia)

we have been working on better data sharing tools for the last few years
we realized the missing piece is an easy way to share and discover datasets
we're calling it Public Bits, publicbits.org
it will aggregate data sources and make them discoverable and easy to download
we see it as a new data distribution system for open data, not just another app ("from centralized portals to decentralized network" diagram)

We’d love to see adoption in major newsrooms, political advocacy organizations, and research labs.

 Users would initially be able to manage their datasets locally, but ideally this tool could be used to package metadata and send it to colleagues, so that others could use the same data environment in different places.
